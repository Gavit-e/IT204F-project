Waiting for Rayyan to finish the sprites so I'm using default sprites for now, take note: 

Bat = Scavenge for food
Apple = Walk in park
Baseball = Beg



Each action will broadcast a message, which will show a textbox 

E.g clicking Beg will show a textbox saying "You got money!"/"You failed to get money."
